  </h2>
  <p>The interpretation of clinical biopsy images for disease diagnoses can be challenging when clinicians are faced
    with distinguishing between distinct but related conditions. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to methods
    in artificial intelligence that help clinicians to translate big data into accurate and quantitative diagnostics. In
    contrast, deep learning or a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a form of artificial intelligence that includes
    machine learning techniques designed to process data and interpret it (eg, by detecting and segmenting multiple
    pixel intensities within a single image and labeling features at a pixel-by-pixel level).</p>

  <p>Pathology has played an essential role in diagnosing gastrointestinal
    disorders. However, errors can occur due to
    complex systems, time constraints and variable inputs.
    This can be further complicated when the biopsy images
    share histological features. Computational methods have the
    potential to address these challenges. In light of this, developing
    assistive computational methods can help mitigate said
    errors. The goal of applying computational methods in identifying
    diseases is for developing fast, reproducible and reasonably
    accurate methods that can be easily standardized.</p>

  <h3>Stain Normalization</h3>
  <p>Before we use the WSIs for analyis we observed visible variations in the color of the images due to differences in
    scanners, staining chemicals used while preparing the slide, and staining methods used across pathology labs. When
    these images were analyzed using deep learning techniques, it led to erroneous results that were not based on the
    features of the image but on color difference. To address this issue we applied Structure Preserving Color
    Normalization described by Vahadane et. al.[12] using a empirically chosen target image from the EE dataset to
    normalize all our images.</p>
